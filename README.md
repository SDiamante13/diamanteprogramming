## Local Build
---
To build locally you must add the ananke theme to the themes folder.

Run the following command:

`git submodule add https://github.com/theNewDynamic/gohugo-theme-ananke.git themes/ananke`

Now you can run the app locally without any errors by running the following command: 

`hugo serve -D`

Navigate to http://localhost:1313 to see changes locally.

The Hugo CLI can be downloaded at [gohugo.io](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/).
