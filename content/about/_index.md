My name is Steven Diamante. I started my first software developer job in June 2017. My major in college was Electrical Engineering so I have been programming for 7 years. I started out with Matlab and moved on to C and C++. After college I worked as a patent classifier in Virginia. During my three years of reading patents about semiconductors, logic circuits, and other electronics, I began my journey back to programming. Using the resources of our technologically advanced time I learned languages such as C# (ASP.Net), Java (Spring Boot), and Python. I worked on some side projects and became addicted to learning new programming skills.

I've decided to start my own blog to teach others what I have learned thus far on my software developer voyage. I continue to learn new things every day and absolutely love what I do.
